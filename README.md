# Personal Running Metrics for tredict

This repository contains personal running metrics for tredict. The metrics are
written in JavaScript in a chatty version. Due to limitations of tredict the
metrics on the website must be no longer than 1024 characters. This this
repository also contains a Makefile that runs a JavaScript minifier on each
metric to produce a minimal version for upload.

## Remarks

There is the local possibility to use C preprocessor directive `#include` to
avoid duplication of code.
